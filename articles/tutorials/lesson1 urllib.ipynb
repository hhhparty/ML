Each handler knows how to open URLs for a particular URL scheme (http, ftp, etc), or how to handle an aspect of URL opening, for example HTTP redirections or HTTP cookies.\n",
    "\n",
    "You will want to create openers if you want to fetch URLs with specific handlers installed, for example to get an opener that handlers cookies, or to get an opener that does not handle redirections.\n",
    "\n",
    "To create an opener, instantiate an OpenerDirector, and then call .add_handler(some handler instance) repeatedly.\n",
    "Alternatively, you can use build_opener, which is a convenience function for creating opener objects with a single function call. build_opener adds several handlers by default, but provides a quick way to add more and/or override the default handlers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Other sorts of handlers you might want to can handle proxies, authentication, and other common but slightly specialised situations.\n",
    "\n",
    "install_opener can be used to make an opener object the (global) default opener. This means that calls to urlopen will use the opener you have installed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Opener objects have an open method, which can be called directly to fetch urls in the same way as the urlopen function: there’s no need to call install_opener, except as a convenience.\n",

    "### Basic Authentication\n",
    "\n",
    "To illustrate creating and installing a handler we will use the HTTPBasicAuthHandler. For a more detailed discussion of this subject – including an explanation of how Basic Authentication works - see the Basic Authentication Tutorial.\n",
    "\n",
    "When authentication is required, the server sends a header (as well as the 401 error code) requesting authentication. This specifies the authentication scheme and a ‘realm’. The header looks like: WWW-Authenticate: SCHEME realm=\"REALM\".\n",
    "\n",
    "e.g.\n",
    "\n",
    "WWW-Authenticate: Basic realm=\"cPanel Users\"\n",
    "\n",
    "The client should then retry the request with the appropriate name and password for the realm included as a header in the request. This is ‘basic authentication’. In order to simplify this process we can create an instance of HTTPBasicAuthHandler and an opener to use this handler.\n",
    "\n",
    "The HTTPBasicAuthHandler uses an object called a password manager to handle the mapping of URLs and realms to passwords and usernames. If you know what the realm is (from the authentication header sent by the server), then you can use a HTTPPasswordMgr. Frequently one doesn’t care what the realm is. In that case, it is convenient to use HTTPPasswordMgrWithDefaultRealm. This allows you to specify a default username and password for a URL. This will be supplied in the absence of you providing an alternative combination for a specific realm. We indicate this by providing None as the realm argument to the add_password method.\n",
    "\n",
    "The top-level URL is the first URL that requires authentication. URLs “deeper” than the URL you pass to .add_password() will also match."

    "### Basic Authentication\n",
    "\n",
    "There is a system for requiring a username&password before a client can visit a webpage. This is called authentication and is implemented on the server. It allows a whole set of pages (called a realm) to be protected by authentication.\n",
    "This scheme are defined by the HTTP spec.\n",
    "The two normal authentication schemes are basic and digest authentication. A summary of basic authentication goes like this :\n",
    "\n",
    "    client makes a request for a webpage\n",
    "    server responds with an error, requesting authentication\n",
    "    client retries request - with authentication details encoded in request\n",
    "    server checks details and sends the page requested, or another error\n",
    "The following sections covers these steps in more details.\n",
    "Error 401 and realms\n",
    "If a page requires authentication then the error code is 401. Included in the response headers will be a 'WWW-authenticate' header. This tells us the authentication scheme the server is using for this page and also something called a realm. It is rarely just a single page that is protected by authentication but a section - a 'realm' of a website. The name of the realm is included in this header line.\n",
    "The 'WWW-Authenticate' header line looks like WWW-Authenticate: SCHEME realm=\"REALM\".\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if you try to access the popular website admin application cPanel your browser will be sent a header that looks like : WWW-Authenticate: Basic realm=\"cPanel\"\n",
    "\n",
    "If the client already knows the username/password for this realm then it can encode them into the request headers and try again. If the username/password combination are correct, then the request will succeed as normal. If the client doesn't know the username/password it should ask the user. This means that if you enter a protected 'realm' the client effectively has to request each page twice. The first time it will get an error code and be told what realm it is attempting to access - the client can then get the right username/password for that realm (on that server) and repeat the request.\n",
    "\n",
    "HTTP is a 'stateless' protocol. This means that a server using basic authentication won't 'remember' you are logged in [5] and will need to be sent the right header for every protected page you attempt to access.\n",
    "\n",
    "First Example\n",
    "Suppose we attempt to fetch a webpage protected by basic authentication. :"
